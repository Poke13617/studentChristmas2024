    <h1>Item #2</h1><br>
    <h4>What is this item?</h4><br>
    <p>This item is somewhat useful to me as it can potentially be a start to a side hustle that some people enjoy. Selling modded consoles can get a bit more than selling consoles that are not modded. This can be fun to do because consoles such as this one and the wii can be bought from thrift stores for cheap (Around $30-40), but they can get around $60 modded, which is around double the price</p>
    <h4>What can this item accomplish for the user?</h4>
    <p>This item can accomplish a lot of different tasks, being used to run other applications on this as if it is a windows computer, just slightly lower end though.</p>
