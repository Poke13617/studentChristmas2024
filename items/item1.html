    <p>The Bella side-eye is something that she does when she hears her name mentioned, but chooses to ignore it instead. This is an amazing thing to have on my wishlist because my cat is absolutely amazing, not screaming(meowing) excessively, but instead doing a little groan-like noise, which is significantly quieter than a typical cat's meows. This is the best trade-off because the only time she makes any noise is when it's 7:00 in the morning, and she wants food.<br><br>She is the best cat I could ask for.
